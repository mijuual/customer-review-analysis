##  Methodology

### 1. Scraping Reviews

Using `scraper.py`, fetch up to 400 reviews per app. Each review contains:

- Review Text
- Rating (1â€“5)
- Date
- Bank/App Name
- Source: Google Play

### 2. Preprocessing 

Using `preprocess.py`, clean data and save as cleaned dataset. Cleaning includes:

- Remove duplicates
- Handle missing values
- Normalize dates to YYYY-MM-DD
- Standardize columns:
review, rating, date, bank, source

3. Sentiment Analysis

- Implemented sentiment classification using VADER (for faster runtime compared to transformer-based models).

- Classified each review as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

- Aggregated sentiment distributions by bank and rating level.

4. Thematic Analysis

- Extracted top keywords and n-grams using TF-IDF.

- Applied topic modeling (LDA) to identify coherent themes from reviews.

- Grouped keywords into 5 core themes:

User Interface & Experience: e.g., easy, simple

Transaction Performance

Account Access Issues

Feature Requests: e.g., update

Customer Support
